The folder contains codes for analysis of graph parameters and loyalty rate.
For dataset, download it from here: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/reddit_reply_networks.tar.gz
Additional files to find loyalty rate of communities can be downloaded from following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qViR5lEgmCob9-OLkd2_Q-sFL6zQU7RL

# Paramters and corresponding files 
* Loyalty rate - get_loyalty_rate.py
* density - get_graph_parameters.py
* Clustering coefficient - get_graph_parameters.py
* Assortativity - get_graph_parameters.py
* Inequality - get_gini.py

# Analysis
analysis.py code is been used to analyze the correlation between structural properties of user interaction graph - density, clustering coefficient, inequality, assortativity - and loyalty rate of the online community.
