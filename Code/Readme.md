The folder contains codes for analysis of graph parameters and loyalty rate.

For dataset, download it from here: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/reddit_reply_networks.tar.gz

Additional files to find loyalty rate of communities can be downloaded from following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qViR5lEgmCob9-OLkd2_Q-sFL6zQU7RL

# Paramters and corresponding files 
* Loyalty rate of a community - _get_loyalty_rate.py_
* Density of a user interaction graph - _get_graph_parameters.py_
* Clustering coefficient of user interaction graph- _get_graph_parameters.py_
* Assortativity of user interaction graph - _get_graph_parameters.py_
* Inequality in user interaction graph- _get_gini.py_

# Analysis
_analysis.py_ code is been used to analyze the correlation between structural properties of user interaction graph - density, clustering coefficient, inequality, assortativity - and loyalty rate of the online community.
