The folder contains codes for analysis of graph parameters and loyalty rate.

# Steps to run this code

1. Download dataset from here: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/reddit_reply_networks.tar.gz

2. Download additional file to find loyalty rate of communities from following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qViR5lEgmCob9-OLkd2_Q-sFL6zQU7RL

3. To generate loyalty rate and graph parameters, run the corresponding file as described below.

4. Run _analysis.py_ to generate graphs and results. 

# Paramters and corresponding files 
* Loyalty rate of a community - _get_loyalty_rate.py_
* Density of a user interaction graph - _get_graph_parameters.py_
* Clustering coefficient of user interaction graph- _get_graph_parameters.py_
* Assortativity of user interaction graph - _get_graph_parameters.py_
* Inequality in user interaction graph - _get_gini.py_
* Number of triads in user interaction graph - _get_graph_parameters.py_

# Analysis
_analysis.py_ code is been used to analyze the correlation between structural properties of user interaction graph - density, clustering coefficient, inequality, assortativity, Number of triads - and loyalty rate of the online community.
