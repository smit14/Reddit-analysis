# Reddit-analysis
The code in the folder is an ancilliary for analysis of loyalty of users in different online communities such as subreddits. The code provides correlation between structural properties of user interaction graph of community and loyalty rate of community. Code is developed in python using Networkx library.

# Objective
Analyzing the parameters of user interaction graphs which affects loyalty of an online community like subreddits. 

# Description
In multi-community platforms, loyalty of user to a particular community is a crucial measurement in this age of internet. When given multiple resources of content, user tends to be loyal to only few of them. Our aim is to show user loyalty and loyalty of a community through a multi-community platform, Reddit. Reddit is a collection of entries submitted by its users. The siteâ€™s content is divided into sections called subreddits or sub-communities. Subreddits are user-created areas of interest. We used data of **2046 subreddits
for 11 months** for the experimentation. We have analyzed the structural properties of the monthly user to user interaction of different subreddits graphs and how the structural parameters are related to the loyalty of communities. The five structural parameters used as a basis to judge are Density, Clustering Coefficient, Assortativity, Number of triads formed and inequality.
